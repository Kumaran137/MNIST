# MNIST

In this mini project i made a model for MNIST dataset using linear and non linear relations
and achieved a max of 91% accuracy in linear relations and a max of 97% accuracy in non linear relations 
and i will try to achieve 99% using Convolutional neural network.

Also this type of data sets are fairly easy for the system so i will try to work with harder datasets like  Cifer
and customm dataset
